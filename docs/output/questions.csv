Q001a,"In a distributed banking system, the server keeps the transaction records of credit cards and provides two services. The first service is for customers to query the available credit limit (a floating-point value) by specifying the credit card number (an integer). The second service is to keep customers informed of their new transactions through callback. To use this service, a customer must register his interest by specifying the credit card number. A callback from the server includes the transaction description (a string) and the amount used (a floating-point value).

Q047b,"A distributed contact tracing system maintains the records of lessons attended by students. The server provides three services. The first service is for the students to register attendance by specifying the location of a lesson (a string), the time of the lesson (two integers, day and hour), and the student name (a string). The second service is for the manager to retrieve all the lessons attended by a particular student by specifying the student name.

Q048a,What is the purpose of mounting in a distributed file system? How is mounting carried out in the NFS?,Essay,Chapter 4 Distributed File Systems,Sun Network File System; Andrew and Coda File Systems,2.pdf
Q048bi,"A distributed file system consists of three computers: a server and two clients A and B. Let f be a single-block file stored at the server. Figure Q2 shows the operations performed by clients A and B on file f, where “o”, “r”, “u” and ""c"" represent open, read, update and close operations respectively. A and B both start with an empty client cache, and the caches are large enough to avoid any replacement. The updates made by B do not change the length of file f. The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible. The operations timeline is as follows: Client A: o,r1 at t=0; r2 at t=2; r3 at t=3; r4 at t=6; r5,c at t=8; o,r6 at t=10; r7 at t=11; r8,c at t=13. Client B: o,u1 at t=1; u2 at t=4; u3,c at t=9. Determine which read operations of A return the file that incorporates the most recent update by B, and determine the time points when the file is transferred from the server to A, given that the system is an NFS.
