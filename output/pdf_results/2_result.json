The server provides three services. The first service is for the students to register attendance by specifying the location of a lesson (a string), the time of the lesson (two integers, day and hour), and the student name (a string). The second service is for the manager to retrieve all the lessons attended by a particular student by specifying the student name. The third service is for the manager to query the names of all the students attending a particular lesson by specifying the location and the time of the lesson. Design a Java remote interface for the server. (5 marks)",

(6 marks)\n\n(b) A distributed file system consists of three computers: a server and two clients A and B. Let f be a single-block file stored at the server. Figure Q2 shows the operations performed by clients A and B on file f, where “o”, “r”, “u” and \"c\" represent open, read, update and close operations respectively. A and B both start with an empty client cache, and the caches are large enough to avoid any replacement. The updates made by B do not change the length of file f. The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible.\n\n[A timeline diagram named Figure Q2 shows operations performed by client A: o, r1 at 0s; r2 at 2s; r3 at 4s; r4 at 6s; r5, c at 8s; o, r6 at 10s; r7 at 12s; r8, c at 14s. Operations by client B: o, u1 at 3s; u2 at 7s; u3, c at 9s.]\n\nFor each of the following cases, determine which read operations of A return the file that incorporates the most recent update by B, and determine the time points when the file is transferred from the server to A.\n(i) The system is an NFS. The clients use a freshness interval of 3 seconds to maintain cache consistency, and client B uses a bio-daemon process to send its updates to the server right after making each update. (7 marks)\n(ii) The system is an AFS that implements session update semantics. (7 marks)",

      "title": "3. Three processes p1, p2 and p3 are running on different computers in an asynchronous distributed system. Each process has a local clock. Figure Q3 shows four messages sent between the processes, where events a to h represent the sending and receiving events of these messages. Let te be the reading of p1's clock at event e, and tg be the reading of p2's clock at event g. Suppose that p3 knows te and tg, as well as the lengths of the time intervals measured by respective clocks as shown in the figure.\n\n[A time-process diagram named Figure Q3 shows: message from p3 event a to p2 event b (800 ms on p3 clock); message from p2 event c to p1 event d (700 ms on p2 clock); message from p1 event e to p2 event f (400 ms on p1 clock); message from p2 event g to p3 event h (30 ms on p2 clock). The time between a and h on p3 clock is 1000 ms.]\n\n(a) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p2's clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to when it receives the message at event k? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks)\n\n(b) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p1's clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to at event h? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks)\n\n(c) Timestamp all the events in Figure Q3 using the vector clocks. (6 marks)\n\n(d) Assume that message delivery on each unidirectional point-to-point channel follows FIFO order. p2 initiates the Chandy-and-Lamport algorithm sometime between events c and f to record a snapshot of the system. List all the possible snapshots finally recorded. Indicate clearly the process states and channel states in the snapshots. In your answer, if needed, use S1, S2 and S3 to represent the initial states of p1, p2 and p3 respectively, and use Sx to represent the state of the process where event x occurs immediately after event x's occurrence (for example, Sa is the state of p3 immediately after event a occurs, and Sc is the state of p2 immediately after event c occurs).
