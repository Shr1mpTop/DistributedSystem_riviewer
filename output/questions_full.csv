Q001,"1. (a) An information server maintains the COVID19 situation reports of different countries and updates them daily. The server would like to keep interested clients informed of the latest report through callback. Design a Java remote interface for the clients to allow the server to perform callback, and a Java remote interface for the server to allow the clients to register and deregister their interests in the report of a specified country.

Q003,"3. A distributed file system consists of a server and two clients A and B. Let f be a singleblock file stored at the server.

A and B both start with an empty client cache, and the caches are large enough to avoid any replacement. The updates made by B do not change the length of file f. The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible. [Image of timeline showing operations for client A (o, r1 at 0s; r2 at 2s; r3 at 4s; r4 at 6s; r5,c at 8s; o,r6 at 9s; r7 at 11s; r8,c at 13s) and client B (o,u1 at 1s; u2 at 5s; u3,c at 9s)  Figure Q2] For each of the following cases, determine which read operations of A return the file that incorporates the most recent update by B, and determine the time points when the file is transferred from the server to A. (i) The system is an NFS. The clients use a freshness interval of 3 seconds to maintain cache consistency, and client B uses a biodaemon process to send its updates to the server right after making each update.

Q051,"3. Three processes p1, p2 and p3 are running on different computers in an asynchronous distributed system. Each process has a local clock. Figure Q3 shows four messages sent between the processes, where events a to h represent the sending and receiving events of these messages. Let te be the reading of p1s clock at event e, and tg be the reading of p2s clock at event g. Suppose that p3 knows te and tg, as well as the lengths of the time intervals measured by respective clocks as shown in the figure. [Image of processtime diagram for p1, p2, p3 with events ah and time intervals. Message from p3(a) to p2(b). Message from p2(c) to p1(d). Message from p1(e) to p2(f). Message from p2(g) to p3(h). Time intervals: d to e is 400ms. c to f is 700ms. f to g is 30ms. a to h is 1000ms. a to c (on p3s clock) is 800ms  Figure Q3] (a) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p2s clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to when it receives the message at event h? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks) (b) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p₁s clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to at event h? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks) (c) Timestamp all the events in Figure Q3 using the vector clocks. (6 marks) (d) Assume that message delivery on each unidirectional pointtopoint channel follows FIFO order. p2 initiates the ChandyandLamport algorithm sometime between events c and f to record a snapshot of the system. List all the possible snapshots finally recorded. Indicate clearly the process states and channel states in the snapshots. In your answer, if needed, use S1, S2 and S3 to represent the initial states of p1, p2 and p3 respectively, and use Sx to represent the state of the process where event x occurs immediately after event xs occurrence (for example, Sa is the state of p3 immediately after event a occurs, and Sc is the state of p2 immediately after event c occurs).

Q052,"4. The vector clock mechanism is used to timestamp the events that occur in a distributed system of three processes p1, p2, p3. Suppose that in a consistent cut, the last event occurring in each process has the following timestamps: p1: (300, 100, 100) p2: (200, 200, 200) p3: (300, a, b) What are the possible ranges of the values a and b respectively?

Q054,"6. Consider a replicated shared object service hosting an integer object x whose initial value is 0. Table Q6 shows the operations performed by two clients on x. For example, read(x)  a denotes a read operation on x returning a value a, and write(x  x  50) denotes a write operation increasing the value of x by 50. The operations of each client are listed in the order that they are performed by the client.
