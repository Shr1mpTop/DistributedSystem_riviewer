Q001,"In a distributed banking system, the server keeps the transaction records of credit cards and provides two services. The first service is for customers to query the available credit limit (a floatingpoint value) by specifying the credit card number (an integer). The second service is to keep customers informed of their new transactions through callback. To use this service, a customer must register his interest by specifying the credit card number. A callback from the server includes the transaction description (a string) and the amount used (a floatingpoint value). Design Java remote interfaces for the server and the customer.

Q118,"Consider a replicated shared object service hosting an integer object x whose initial value is 0. Table Q6 shows the operations performed by two clients on x. For example, read(x)  a denotes a read operation on x returning a value a, and write(x  x  50) denotes a write operation increasing the value of x by 50. The operations of each client are listed in the order that they are performed by the client.
