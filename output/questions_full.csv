Q001,"In a distributed banking system, the server keeps the transaction records of credit cards and provides two services. The first service is for customers to query the available credit limit (a floatingpoint value) by specifying the credit card number (an integer). The second service is to keep customers informed of their new transactions through callback. To use this service, a customer must register his interest by specifying the credit card number. A callback from the server includes the transaction description (a string) and the amount used (a floatingpoint value).

The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible. (i) The system is an NFS. The clients use a freshness interval of 3 seconds to maintain cache consistency, and client B uses a biodaemon process to send its updates to the server right after making each update.
