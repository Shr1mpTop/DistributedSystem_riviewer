Q001,(a) What are idempotent and nonidempotent operations? (3 marks),Short Answer,Chapter 1 Characterization of Distributed Systems & System Models
Q002,"(b) A distributed contact tracing system maintains the records of lessons attended by students. The server provides three services. The first service is for the students to register attendance by specifying the location of a lesson (a string), the time of the lesson (two integers, day and hour), and the student name (a string). The second service is for the manager to retrieve all the lessons attended by a particular student by specifying the student name. The third service is for the manager to query the names of all the students attending a particular lesson by specifying the location and the time of the lesson. Design a Java remote interface for the server. (5 marks)",Programming,Chapter 3 Distributed Objects & Remote Invocation
Q003,(a) What is the purpose of mounting in a distributed file system? How is mounting carried out in the NFS? (6 marks),Short Answer,Chapter 4 Distributed File Systems
Q004,"(b) A distributed file system consists of three computers: a server and two clients A and B. Let f be a singleblock file stored at the server. Figure Q2 shows the operations performed by clients A and B on file f, where o, r, u and ""c"" represent open, read, update and close operations respectively. A and B both start with an empty client cache, and the caches are large enough to avoid any replacement. The updates made by B do not change the length of file f. The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible. Figure Q2 Description: A timeline from 0 to 14 seconds. Operations by client A: o, r1 at 0s; r2 at 2s; r3 at 4s; r4 at 6s; r5, c at 8s; o, r6 at 9s; r7 at 11s; r8, c at 13s. Operations by client B: o, u1 at 1s; u2 at 5s; u3, c at 9s. For each of the following cases, determine which read operations of A return the file that incorporates the most recent update by B, and determine the time points when the file is transferred from the server to A. (i) The system is an NFS. The clients use a freshness interval of 3 seconds to maintain cache consistency, and client B uses a biodaemon process to send its updates to the server right after making each update. (7 marks) (ii) The system is an AFS that implements session update semantics. (7 marks)",Calculation,Chapter 4 Distributed File Systems
Q005,"Three processes p1, p2 and p3 are running on different computers in an asynchronous distributed system. Each process has a local clock. Figure Q3 shows four messages sent between the processes, where events a to h represent the sending and receiving events of these messages. Let te be the reading of p1s clock at event e, and tg be the reading of p2s clock at event g. Suppose that p3 knows te and tg, as well as the lengths of the time intervals measured by respective clocks as shown in the figure. Figure Q3 Description: A time diagram for processes P1, P2, P3.  Message from P3(a) to P2(c). Time interval on P3 from a to h is 1000ms.  Message from P2(b) to P1(d). Time interval on P2 from c to g is 700ms.  Message from P1(e) to P2(f). Time interval on P1 from d to e is 400ms.  Message from P2(g) to P3(h). Time interval on P2 from f to g is 30ms. Time interval on P3 from receipt of message from P2 to event h is 800ms (this seems to conflict with the a to h interval  interpreting 800ms as the duration on P3 from some event to h, possibly event a to a point before h, or the message send from P2 to h is 800ms. Lets assume the diagram labels are intervals: (d,e) is 400ms on P1 clock. (c,g) is 700ms on P2 clock. (f,g) is 30ms on P2 clock. (a,h) is 1000ms on P3 clock. The 800ms arrow points from P2 to P3, but its labeled under P3s line, likely indicating a duration on P3. The 700ms arrow is under P2s line between c and g. (a) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p2s clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to when it receives the message at event h? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks)",Calculation,Chapter 7 Time and Global States

Q007,(c) With reference to Figure Q3 in Question 3: Timestamp all the events in Figure Q3 using the vector clocks. (6 marks),Calculation,Chapter 7 Time and Global States
Q008,"(d) With reference to Figure Q3 in Question 3: Assume that message delivery on each unidirectional pointtopoint channel follows FIFO order. p2 initiates the ChandyandLamport algorithm sometime between events c and f to record a snapshot of the system. List all the possible snapshots finally recorded. Indicate clearly the process states and channel states in the snapshots. In your answer, if needed, use S1, S2 and S3 to represent the initial states of p1, p2 and p3 respectively, and use Sx to represent the state of the process where event x occurs immediately after event xs occurrence (for example, Sa is the state of p3 immediately after event a occurs, and Sc is the state of p2 immediately after event c occurs).

Q009,"The vector clock mechanism is used to timestamp the events that occur in a distributed system of three processes p1, p2, p3. Suppose that in a consistent cut, the last event occurring in each process has the following timestamps: p1: (300, 100, 100) p2: (200, 200, 200) p3: (300, a, b) What are the possible ranges of the values a and b respectively?

Q010,"(a) Suppose that the Ricart and Agrawala algorithm is used for distributed mutual exclusion among n processes p1, p2, ..., pn. Below is the partial pseudocode of the algorithm executed by a process pi. Complete the algorithm by filling in the boxes A to F with appropriate pseudocode.

Q011,"(b) In the Ricart and Agrawala algorithm, suppose the statement ""T : the timestamp of the request by the logical clock"" is changed to T : a random number"".

Q012,"Consider a replicated shared object service hosting an integer object x whose initial value is 0. Table Q6 shows the operations performed by two clients on x. For example, read(x)  a denotes a read operation on x returning a value a, and write(x  x  50) denotes a write operation increasing the value of x by 50. The operations of each client are listed in the order that they are performed by the client. Table Q6: Program order is downwards. Client A: write(x  x  6); read(x)  a; write(x  x  50); read(x)  b Client B: write(x  x  400); read(x)  c; read(x)  400; read(x)  d (a) If the object service is sequentially consistent, what are the possible combinations of the values a and b?
