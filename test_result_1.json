The first service is for the students to register attendance by specifying the location of a lesson (a string), the time of the lesson (two integers, day and hour), and the student name (a string). The second service is for the manager to retrieve all the lessons attended by a particular student by specifying the student name. The third service is for the manager to query the names of all the students attending a particular lesson by specifying the location and the time of the lesson.

      "title": "(b) A distributed file system consists of three computers: a server and two clients A and B. Let f be a single-block file stored at the server. Figure Q2 shows the operations performed by clients A and B on file f, where “o”, “r”, “u” and \"c\" represent open, read, update and close operations respectively. A and B both start with an empty client cache, and the caches are large enough to avoid any replacement. The updates made by B do not change the length of file f. The transmission delay in the network and the processing times at the computers are negligible.\n\nFigure Q2 Description: A timeline from 0 to 14 seconds. \nOperations by client A: o, r1 at 0s; r2 at 2s; r3 at 4s; r4 at 6s; r5, c at 8s; o, r6 at 9s; r7 at 11s; r8, c at 13s. \nOperations by client B: o, u1 at 1s; u2 at 5s; u3, c at 9s.\n\nFor each of the following cases, determine which read operations of A return the file that incorporates the most recent update by B, and determine the time points when the file is transferred from the server to A.\n(i) The system is an NFS. The clients use a freshness interval of 3 seconds to maintain cache consistency, and client B uses a bio-daemon process to send its updates to the server right after making each update.

      "title": "Three processes p1, p2 and p3 are running on different computers in an asynchronous distributed system. Each process has a local clock. Figure Q3 shows four messages sent between the processes, where events a to h represent the sending and receiving events of these messages. Let te be the reading of p1's clock at event e, and tg be the reading of p2's clock at event g. Suppose that p3 knows te and tg, as well as the lengths of the time intervals measured by respective clocks as shown in the figure.\n\nFigure Q3 Description: A time diagram for processes P1, P2, P3. \n- Message from P3(a) to P2(c). Time interval on P3 from a to h is 1000ms. \n- Message from P2(b) to P1(d). Time interval on P2 from c to g is 700ms. \n- Message from P1(e) to P2(f). Time interval on P1 from d to e is 400ms. \n- Message from P2(g) to P3(h). Time interval on P2 from f to g is 30ms. Time interval on P3 from receipt of message from P2 to event h is 800ms (this seems to conflict with the a to h interval - interpreting 800ms as the duration on P3 from some event to h, possibly event 'a' to a point before 'h', or the message send from P2 to h is 800ms. Let's assume the diagram labels are intervals: (d,e) is 400ms on P1 clock. (c,g) is 700ms on P2 clock. (f,g) is 30ms on P2 clock. (a,h) is 1000ms on P3 clock. The 800ms arrow points from P2 to P3, but it's labeled under P3's line, likely indicating a duration on P3. The 700ms arrow is under P2's line between c and g.\n\n(a) If p3 would like to synchronize its clock with p2's clock as accurately as possible, what time should p3 set its clock to when it receives the message at event h? What is the accuracy of this setting? (5 marks)",
